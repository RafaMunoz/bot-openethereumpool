# Telegram Bot - Open Ethereum Pool

If you are using [Open Ethereum Pool](https://github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool), you may want to implement this Telegram Bot to see the statistics of your Pool and your Wallets at all times.

# Get Started

This Bot is mounted on Docker, so implementing it is very easy. You just need to have a database [MongoDB 4.2.6-bionic](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) and this container.

It is important that the database with your username and password are previously created before launching the bot.

## Environment variables
A continuaciÃ³n puedes ver las Environment variables necesarias para el funcionamiento de este contenedor.

 - **$TELEGRAM_TOKEN** -> Token to access the HTTP API of your bot. 
 
 - **$URI_MONGODB**	-> Connection URI with your MongoDB database. 
 
> For example: mongodb://user:pass@192.168.1.2/OpenEthereumPool

 - **$URL_POOL** -> URL of your Pool and where the bot will be able to consult the statistics.

## Start the Container

To run this bot using Docker you can use the following command:

    docker run -d \
    -e "TELEGRAM_TOKEN=YOUR-TELEGRAM-TOKEN" \
    -e "URI_MONGODB=YOUR_URI_CONNECT_MONGODB" \
    -e "URL_POOL=URL_FOR_YOUR_POOL" \
